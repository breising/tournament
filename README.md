###Tournament App

A very basic app for creating Swiss style tournament pairings using python2.7 and Postgres db.

###Functionality
The app is setup with a unit test to verify that all the primary functions produce to proper output. There is no real user interface. It is run from the command line. 


###To run the app:
The app runs on an Ubuntu/vagrant machine with Python2.7/psycopg2 and requires install of Postgres db.
Once dependencies are installed, run the tournament_test file from the command line. `$  python tournament_test.py`
This test app will run through and test all the functions in the tournament.py file. If all goes well, and also if not, you'll see a report.
